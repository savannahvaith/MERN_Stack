## Mongo DB

Mongo DB is a document store, which is *non-relational* - meaning each entry represents a whole object rather than having multiple objects spread across different tables.

Here's the difference between a relational and non-relational database:

| Tabular (Relational) | MongoDB (Non-relational)|
| --- | ---|
| Database | Database|
|Table | Collection|
|Row | Document|
|Index| Index|
|Foreign Key| Reference|

*Documents* in Mongo are stored in BSON (Binary JSON), which like JSON stores data in key-value pairs.

It can be used when your data has no fixed structure, and there is no strong relationship between different collections.
